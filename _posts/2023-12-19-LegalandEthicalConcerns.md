Essential Knowledge 
- IOC-1.F.1 Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization. 
- IOC-1.F.2 Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use. 
- IOC-1.F.3 Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property. 
- IOC-1.F.4 The use of material created by someone else without permission and presented as one’s own is plagiarism and may have legal consequences.
- IOC-1.F.6 The use of material created by someone other than you should always be cited. 
- IOC-1.F.7 Creative Commons, open source, and open access have enabled broad access to digital information.
- IOC-1.F.8 As with any technology or medium, using computing to harm individuals or groups raises legal and ethical concerns. 
- IOC-1.F.9 Computing can play a role in social and political issues, which in turn often raises legal and ethical concerns.

## What is intellectual property?

Intellectual property is a work or invention that is the result of creativity, to which one has rights over. 

In the modernized world today, intellectual property can be shared more easily now through the Internet. This raises concerns about who owns something that was created digitally. 

## Copyright

Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone else from using it, unless they have permission. Anything you create like a picture you took or a digital drawing, you automatically own an “All rights reserved” copyright. If we pretend that material is our own then it becomes plagiarism 

There are ways to create material for others to use: 

Creative Commons
- Provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creation
- Examples: If you draw a picture and you want other people to use and distribute it without asking for permission. If you have a song that you want to freely share 
- It clearly outlines whether certain people can use it for creative commons, whether it’s commercial or for another reason 

Open Source
- Are open for anyone to use and the IP can be modified in whatever ways people want, thus encouraging open collaboration 
- Refers exclusively to software

Open Access 
- Online research output free of any restrictions (like copyright or license restrictions) and free of use so people can use this however they wish
- Example: Open access databases with journals and research papers for others to reference and use

- Give an example of an open-source software and explain why it is an open source.
Github; it allows people to code and fork repositories without asking for permission. People can also collaborate and share what they have coded with the whole team.

## Legal/Ethical Concerns

No matter how you use something, it’s still important to cite information and give credit where it belongs. There is so information at our fingertips and though open source programs may be created with good intentions, people will sometimes use these open sources and modify them to harm individuals or groups. 

There are legal concerns regarding computing devices that collect and analyze data by monitoring individual activity. Digital media downloads can sometimes include viruses and harmful programs

#### Digital Divide and Bias 

Some software may include algorithms with bias. The training data for the software might underrepresent certain groups or demographics. Lack of fairness in algorithmic decision-making can perpetuate societal inequalities.

The digital divide is the unequal distribution of access to technology Although the Internet provides all these resources for us to use, certain groups of people do not have the technology readily available for them to use. These databases and online resources are only beneficial to those who have the opportunities and privileges to understand and access technology.

- What is another legal or ethical concern regarding intellectual property in technology?
Piracy/Pirating; People are unable to make money from their creative projects that they worked hard on because their work was stolen. Specifically, something they made using their creativity was advertised as a 'free' thing and someone else made money from that.

Complete these five free response questions and send them to Taj on Slack by December 21, 11:59 pm. You will be graded on how much effort you put into your answer. 

1. What is the difference between open source and open access? 
Open source allows people to modify the work of others without copyright restrictions. So, there will be more collaboration between people, while open access is a way of sharing scientific research. It involves online research journals and articles that provide people access to them. For example, Google Scholar allows researchers to look up whatever articles suit their research projects best. 

2. What is the importance of copyright?

Copyright is important because it is used to ensure that whatever you create stays yours. It allows you to choose what you can do with it and what people you want to be able to access it. It also keeps our IP protected in case someone wants to use our creations for plagiarism. 

3. What is a way people can harm individuals or groups through open source data? 

People can create viruses or turn open source data into fake sites that people could give their information on. This could lead to identity theft which could harm individuals or even groups if done on a large enough scale. This is a security concern because people could lose their individual data. Also, if you are in business, you could lose your business model and somebody can make money from your idea.

4. What term describes the unequal distribution of access to technology? 

The digital divide is the unequal distribution of access to technology. It prevents people from being able to have the same internet access to use the same databases or journals for reasearch due to people having a lack of technology or training and access to technological devices.

5. How do you see intellectual property in 20 years (be creative)?

I see intellectual property in 20 years as something mostly digital, where people create songs and programs on the Internet along with more development in AI. People could ruin others' songs by removing some of the lyrics/ quality of sound and selling them as their own because of open source technology. If there is plagiarism, copyrighted laws will be more severe. Every time a song is added to apps like Spotify, they could have their lyrics and quality of sound compared to other songs to check for plagiarism.
