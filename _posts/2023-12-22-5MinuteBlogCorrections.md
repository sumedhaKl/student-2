Corrections:

I got a 35/67 or 52%

Question 1. Multiply x by 3 inside a loop 

The correct answer was 2*3*3*3*3

I included the starting digit 2 in my final display of the result. Next time, I will have to be more careful about the exact answer.

Question 6: Correctness of robot programs
The correct answer was both programs

Both programs showed two different ways of moving the robot which I did not see. I will be more careful in the future that a different program can show a different way of doing the same thing.

Question 9: Transmit Private Data securely
The correct answer was key encryption. 

Private data can be hacked into no matter the routing. I did not understand the concept of key encryption very well in class. Also, I didn't see the college board videos on keys.


Question 15: Science museum tickets
The correct answer was a program using only IF but i chose a program with and IF ELSE condiiton.

The ELSE condition added a step which made the program more confusing. People over 12 and those going on a tour were both included in the same cost. 


Question 15: Compare output of program a and b
The correct answer is that both programs display the same values only the starting value differs.

I will have to pay close attention to how the answers are worded. When I saw that the two programs started with different values, I jumped to the conclusion that the values differ.

Question 18: Algorithm to move robot to goal
The correct answer was an algorithm that specified every step for the computer.

Any code that I use in such a problem has to be very clear and exact with every single step written out.

Question 22: Simulate spinner
The correct answer was the Move 2 spaces condition in the Else block. 

I learned that the condition with the highest probability goes in the Else block.

Question 25: How Internet facilitates large scale communication
The correct answer was that data is routed and protocols are used. Internet is not controlled by a central computer.

Question 29: Lossless Compression Scenario
The correct answer is that data is compressed before bein transmitted and then opened back up again.

I need to learn and understand how data can be compressed and transmitted in detail.

Question 33: What can be determined from the course grade data
The correct answer of information that cannot be determined is the highest grade in an assignment.

This makes sense since the output is the combined average of all assignment scores.

Question 34:Botmover
The correct answer was Botmover 1, Botmover 3 and Botmover 0.

I understood the botmover program to move forward x times and move right only once but it was the other way around. 

Question 35: Generalization of MaxTwo and MaxThree
The correct answer was procedur Max Numlist. My answer did not generalize the program, it just made it specific to 4 values.

Question 37: DrawLine on a coordinate grid
The correct answer was Drawline followed by y-2. I had the same answer but in the wrong order. The computer will draw the lines only when the coordinates are given to it and that was my mistake.

Question 39: Error in calculating sum
The correct answer was that lines 5 and 6 should be interchanged. My answer of making i>10 does not fix the code.

The problem was that the code incremented the i value before adding it to the sum. 

Question 44: Remove connections in network configuration
The correct answer was 2 which was the miminum number of connections needed to be cut to isolate a computer. 
Here also I learned that I need to look at all possible solutions before coming up with an answer. I was looking at how to isolate computer T but I could also have isolated computer U which had only 2 connections.

Question 45: Coin Flip Simulation
The correct answer had a sum of all flips which displayed True when sum was 0 or 3. My answer did not have the sum command, only random flips. This will allow a player to win only when it has heads or tails, not the sum of all attempts.

Question 47: Requirements for binary search
Question 49: Unique bit sequences for staff
The correct answer was 7 but I chose 8. 
With 8 bits, the number of combinations will be 256 but we have only 100 employees, so 7 will work. Binary is base 2 and the total combinations are 2 to the power of the number of bits used.

Question 50. Reasonable time algorithms
The correct answer was I,II and III. Reasonable time does not mean the shortest time, it means the algorithm must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function.

Question 51: Creative Commons
The correct answer was was Creative commons gives content creators the ability to tell how their work should be used. Previously copyrighted works are governed by copyright rules. 

Question 52: Bacteria population simulation
The correct answer was that the Repeat until loop stops after 24 hours. My answer of giving bacterial population every hour was wrong because the program only increments every hour but displays only the final answer after the whole simulation finishes running.

Question 56: Compare execution times of two versions
The correct answer was version 2 takes longer than version 1 because it gets prediction for each element in the list twice. Program 1 only gets the prediction once.

Question 57: Purpose of Internet protocols
The correct answer was to establish a common protocol for communication. Internet is not completely secure.

Question 58: Error in AnyPairs procedure
The correct answer was bat, cat, bat. When x is not equal to y and y is not equal to Z then the program will return false which is not the intended value.

Question 59: Advantages of open source software
The correct answer was it provided low cost support which is NOT an advantage of open source. My answer of original developers not being involved is actually an advantage of open source. I read the question wrong and gave something that was an advantage when the question was asking for something else.

Question 60: Number of elements in one list but not both
The correct answer created a unique list that removed duplicates from both lists which displayed the correct answer in the next step. 
I can maybe use numbers to get a better idea in my head about how exactly a program will execute. Unless we create a unique list, the last step of length list 1 + length list 2-combined list maybe wrong.

Question 62: Which selection statement will display true
The correct answers were A and C. My answer was partially correct but I did not take into account that with true OR false, True is displayed. So the puedocode for choice A was also correct. 

Question 64: Error with multiplicati0on using repeated addition
The correct answer were B and D. Since the code is only about the x value, only the x value gets incremented by 1. The code will stop when y>0 but since y is never incremented, it will never go above 0 if it starts with a negative value. So the code will never end.

Question 65: Calls to concat and substring
The correct answers were B and C. I chose only one, so my answer was only partially right. In one answer, the substring function isolates the word 'lope' then 'a' and then 'jack'. In the other answer, the word 'jack' is isolated, then 'a' and then 'lope'.

Question 66: Error in counting perfect numbers
The correct answer is lines 5 and lines 9. 'count' should be incremented but only inside the body of the IF statement. Similarly, currennum does not need to be repeated again, it has already been incremented inside the IF statement.

Question 67: Error in numOccurrences procedure
The correct answerw are "birch, maple, birch' and 'birch,oak,birch' because everytime maple or birch is counted as one, the count restarts at zero and it is lost. So the intended value is not returned, only 0 is returned everytime. 




Journey: Through these mistakes, I realize that I could have gotten the questions right if I went through them again after the team teaches. I also will try to spend even more time actually thinking about each question instead of rushing to get through it like today. Specifically, I am good with extracting information from data, binary numbers, crowdsourcing, simulations, and boolean expressions. However, I struggled with and was unable to understand questions on identifying and correcting errors, calling procedures, iteration, developing algorithms, and nested conditionals. For example: I need to understand and think through robot problems. I also struggle with understanding algorithms because I need to learn how each part of the code works when given a specific code and asked to answer questions on it. I also need to understand how pseudocode works better. the internet, safe computing, legal and ethical concerns, fault tolerance also require more attention to detail from me. In some questions, I answered the correct value when the question was which is NOT the correct value, so I need to read and work through questions more carefully.
