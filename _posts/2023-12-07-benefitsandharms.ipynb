    "## Programming Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming, like any other field, has both beneficial and potentially harmful aspects. The more that programming advances, the more we have to discuss benefits and harmful effects that it brings to society.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of Program with Both Beneficial and Harmful Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Automated phone system of a customer service line for a major company\n",
    "def check_business_hours(hour):\n",
    "    return 8 <= hour < 18\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        user_input = input(\"Please enter the current time (24-hour format, e.g., 14 for 2:00 PM): \")\n",
    "        current_time = int(user_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "        if check_business_hours(current_time):\n",
    "            print(\"You are being connected to customer service.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Sorry, the business is closed at the moment. Please call back during business hours (8 am to 6 pm).\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid 24-hour time.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beneficial Effects:\n",
    "- It saves time for both parties as they limit the hours that a worker needs to answer calls for the company.\n",
    "- It checks whether the entered time is within the business hours (8 am to 6 pm). This ensures that customers are only connected to customer service during operational hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative Effects:\n",
    "- The time may not be versatile for people in different time zones.\n",
    "- The system lacks customization options such as providing services available outside business hours, offering automated assistance, or redirecting to online support resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Benefits and Harmful Effects of a Multirotor (Drone)\n",
    "\n",
    "A multirotor, also known as a drone, is a type of rotorcraft that has multiple rotors. Inventions such as these are the same as code and have harmful and beneficial effects.\n",

Our use of the internet can cultivate dopamine feedback loops, such as when your crush likes your post on Instagram, you get a snap back from that cute girl, or you find a funny TikTok that makes you laugh hysterically. These make us want to seek out these feelings more and more and experience those seconds of happiness. These effects of the internet lead to people having major issues like sleep deprivation, depression, and anxiety.\n",

    "## Homework Hack: Come up with a Program with beneficial and harmful effects. (You don't have to code it, but your ideas have to be detailed and organized)\n",
    "\n",
    "(Homework right here)\n",
    "A program that keeps track of orders for online shopping deliveries. Benefits: People can track their orders and see how long they're going to take to arrive. The program uses IP addresses to track zip codes. It quickly provides local suppliers by prompting people to place orders based on their zip codes. This gives customers a specific window of time in which their order will arrive. The program keeps track of your past orders and subscriptions. This allows people to re order something with just a click. Harms: The program tracks addresses and is public. People might not want to make their address public. Also, the program records credit card numbers. This could be an issue if somebody hacks into a shopper's account. They can use their money to make purchases. Some online shopping apps ask for telephone numbers to let customers know when their order is delivered. Email address is also asked for. Both of these can be hacked and personal contact information can be accessed by anyone.\n",
