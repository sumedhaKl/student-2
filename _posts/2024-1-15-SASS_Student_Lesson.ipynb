    "### What is SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "SASS is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It takes input data and converts it into CSS, which is then used by the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding differences: CSS V/S SASS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSS:** Cascading style sheets or CSS is the standard styling language for the web, providing a simple and direct syntax for styling HTML elements. However, it lacks certain features found in preprocessors like Sass, making it less understandable and difficult to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/* Basic CSS Code */\n",
    "\n",

    "- **SASS:** SASS is a powerful preprocessor scripting language that enhances CSS with advanced features. Sass introduces variables, nesting, and mixins, requiring compilation into standard CSS for browsers to interpret.\n",

    "## Benefits of SASS over CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Code Organization:**\n",
    "   - Nesting Capabilities: Sass organizes styles like a neat notebook, mirroring HTML structure for clarity.\n",
    "   - Modular Approach: Break styles into smaller files, like building blocks, for a cleaner and more organized project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintainability:**\n",
    "   - Use of Variables: Easily update colors and fonts with name-tag-like variables.\n",
    "   - Mixins for Reusable Code: Create styles once, reuse them everywhere.\n",
    "   - Extend/Inheritance: Share styles among elements to avoid repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Features:**\n",
    "   - Control Directives: Add conditions to styles for more flexibility.\n",
    "   - Built-in Functions: Use Sass tools for colors and math in styles.\n",
    "   - Compatibility: Sass handles browser differences, ensuring a consistent look across all browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Compilation: Translate Sass to standard CSS for browsers.\n",
    "   - Usage: Command Sass to compile styles effortlessly.\n",
    "   - Watching Files: Sass auto-updates styles as you make changes, simplifying the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nesting\n",

    "\n",
    "In HTML, you don't directly use Sass; instead, you use the compiled CSS generated from Sass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <h4>Steps to use predefined SASS</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install SASS: Before you use SASS you need to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install -g sass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create SASS file: Write your SASS file code and be sure to give it the extension of \".scss\"\n",

    "  background-color: $primary-color;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compile SASS into CSS: Use installed SASS compiler to convert the .scss file into a .css file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sass input.scss output.css\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Link compiled CSS into the HTML/JS project code\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <!--Meta data here -->\n",

    "Using the steps above, create an SCSS file with SASS code for a simple button, convert the file to a .css and link it into a new HTML file. The final output needs to be a button with a color of your choice.\n",

    "// Your code here\n",
    "$button-color: #27ae60;\n",

    "SASS provides a powerful and efficient way to write CSS by introducing features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more. By using SASS, you can enhance code organization, maintainability, and take advantage of advanced features. Remember to compile your SASS code into CSS before using it in your HTML projects.
