We looked at three groups: Austin's group, Hanlun's group, and Advik's group. 
In Austin's group, the team introduced an innovative weather application featuring a unique set of functions, setting it apart from other projects. Regrettably, they encountered difficulties in showcasing their full range of features due to a backend system crash. They leveraged a weather API to predict weather patterns and skillfully displayed real-time temperatures using a separate API in their frontend. The user interface received praise, although it could have been even more captivating had the five-year weather prediction graph functioned as intended. Considering the project's distinctiveness and potential, it merits a rating of 4.8 out of 5, with some features omitted due to the backend crash.

In Hanlun's group, they crafted an impressive chess application, notably exemplified through Yeongsu Demo, presenting a sophisticated and practical chess game. They integrated the Whisp chat system, which boasts a user interface reminiscent of popular platforms like Discord. What sets this project apart is how the chess game communicates move changes through post requests to AWS and displays these moves on the opponent's side. The Whisp's capability to edit the database via a URL introduces valuable moderation features. While the chess game excels in terms of application, the Whisp could benefit from additional user management features. All in all, this project deserves an impressive 8.8 out of 9, showcasing both uniqueness and outstanding functionality.

For Advik's group, The team unveiled an engaging project with a touch of humor, targeting a specific audience with a Breaking Bad theme. The idea of a song finder was intriguing, although its full potential couldn't be realized due to server crashes. Their Breaking Bad simulator introduced a playful and entertaining dimension to the project. From a technical perspective, they effectively implemented a backend system that seamlessly communicated with the frontend for music-related tasks. Usability could be enhanced by focusing more on frontend design, but the project's functional core holds great promise with further refinement. In summary, this project garners an impressive rating of 8.7 out of 9 for its creative approach, promising features, and potential for future improvements.
