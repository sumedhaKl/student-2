        <p class="text">We started off with a language model able to speak Shakespeare. But it didn't seem to give the users a purpose so we then switched to a text extender which extends text from books on an Amazon Book Catalog we made. It also gives us the main story of the book which helps users know whether they want to get this book from Amazon or not.</p>
