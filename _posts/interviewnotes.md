must have resume - will/might modify REHS one
have a commitment
might apply for ml frontend developer but could just choose frontend engineer/developer or something like that instead
technical questions will be about code - will depend on code chosen (either ml or CPT thing, not sure which), must answer exactly
figure out how to use LinkedIn, try adding as much as I can to it
inspo: show github profile, connect chosen code to real life stuff, like jobs or volunteering, or other extracurriculars 
advice: don't start about page on linkedin w/hello; talk about job instead along w/skills
about page should be general while resume should be more specific to the job

Unique qualification that makes you the right person for the task.
I am dedicated, persistent, and flexible as I am able to effectively collaborate with my peers in a group on what to do in order for the code to work best. As I have had a lot of experience working with ML in frontend code, always trying to find new ways to get it to work along with rewriting code to work regardless of where the data is stored, I believe I am the best candidate for this job as these are my unique qualities that makes me the right person for this task. Thank you for having me.
