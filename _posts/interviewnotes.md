must have resume - will/might modify REHS one
have a commitment
might apply for ml frontend developer but could just choose frontend engineer/developer or something like that instead
technical questions will be about code - will depend on code chosen (either ml or CPT thing, not sure which), must answer exactly
figure out how to use LinkedIn, try adding as much as I can to it
inspo: show github profile, connect chosen code to real life stuff, like jobs or volunteering, or other extracurriculars 
advice: don't start about page on linkedin w/hello; talk about job instead along w/skills
about page should be general while resume should be more specific to the job
