## Identifying and Correcting Errors (Unit 1.4)

> Become familiar with types of errors and strategies for fixing them

- Review CollegeBoard videos and take notes on blog
- Complete assigned MCQ questions if applicable

# Code Segments

Practice fixing the following code segments!

## Segment 1: Alphabet List

Intended behavior: create a list of characters from the string contained in the variable `alphabet`

### Code:


```python
%%js

var alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
var alphabetList = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	alphabetList.push(i);
}

console.log(alphabetList);
```

### What I Changed

I changed the for loop to say alphabet which the previous code didn't have.

## Segment 2: Numbered Alphabet

Intended behavior: print the number of a given alphabet letter within the alphabet. For example:
```
"_" is letter number _ in the alphabet
```

Where the underscores (_) are replaced with the letter and the position of that letter within the alphabet (e.g. a=1, b=2, etc.)

### Code:


```python
%%js

// Copy your previous code to built alphabetList here

let letterNumber = 5

for (var i = 0; i < alphabetList; i++) {
	if (i === letterNumber) {
		console.log(letterNumber + " is letter number 1 in the alphabet")
	}
}

// Should output:
// "e" is letter number 5 in the alphabet
```

### What I Changed

I changed the for loop so i will be compared to the length of the alphabet list array. I also changed the letter number code so it would say that letter number is at position 5 in the alphabet.

## Segment 3: Odd Numbers

Intended behavior: print a list of all the odd numbers below 10

### Code:


```python
%%js

let evens = [];
let i = 0;

while (i <= 10) {
  evens.push(i);
  i += 2;
}

console.log(evens);
```

### What I Changed

I changed that variable name to odds and made the let statement say that it should start from 1 so the odd numbers would be included. I edited the while loop so the odd numbers would be pushed into the "odds" array. I then edited the += function so the previous value would be incremented by 2 to get the next odd number. 

# BELOW NOT EDITED

The intended outcome is printing a number between 1 and 100 once, if it is a multiple of 2 or 5 
- What values are outputted incorrectly. Why?
- Make changes to get the intended outcome.


```python
%%js

var numbers = []
var newNumbers = []
var i = 0

while (i < 100) {
    numbers.push(i)
    i += 1
}
for (var i of numbers) {
    if (numbers[i] % 5 === 0)
        newNumbers.push(numbers[i])
    if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0)
        newNumbers.push(numbers[i])
else if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0 and 
            % 5 === 0)
        newNumbers.donotrepeat(numbers[i])
}
console.log(newNumbers)
```

# Challenge

This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation.
- What are some ways to (user) error proof this code?
- The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user

Hint:
- write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program
- test - input burger, expect output of burger price
- run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
- write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass

Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work.


```python
%%js

<html>
<head>
    <title>Menu</title>
    <script>
        var burgerPrice = 3.99;
        var friesPrice = 1.99;
        var drinkPrice = 0.99;
        
        var total = 0; // Initialize total cost to 0.

        var burgerChoice = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter 1 if you choose a burger"));
        var friesChoice = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter 2 if you choose fries"));
        var drinkChoice = parseFloat(prompt("Please enter 3 if you choose a drink"));

        if (burgerChoice === 1) {
            total += burgerPrice;
        }
        
        if (friesChoice === 2) {
            total += friesPrice;
        }
        
        if (drinkChoice === 3) {
            total += drinkPrice;
        }

        document.write("Total: $" + total.toFixed(2) + "<br>");
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

```

## Hacks
> Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project...
- What errors may arise in your project?
- What are some test cases that can be used?
- Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem.
- What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project?
    * As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests.
