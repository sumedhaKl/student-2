    "### Additional Notes and Closing Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ORM (Object Relational Mapping):** This code heavily relies on SQLAlchemy ORM, which allows you to interact with your database using Python classes and objects rather than direct SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security:** Storing passwords as hashes is a good security practice. The code uses the `generate_password_hash` function to securely hash passwords and `check_password_hash` to verify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing:** The `initUsers` function is used to initialize the database with sample data for testing. You may remove or modify this function based on your project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Interaction:** The code includes functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user information. It also checks user credentials during login.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Note:** Always be careful when handling user data and ensure that your application complies with privacy and data protection regulations."
