## Flow of Information

The information in a code flows in a direction based on the loops and conditional statements written.

## What is iteration?

Iteration is the looping of data in a code sequence based on loops and conditional statements. In Python, iteration is done using While loops and For loops.

## While loops


While loops are used when the looping depends on a condition. As long as the condition is true, the code will be executed. When the condition becomes false, the loop stops.


In a while loop, we need to specify the index value (where the loop starts) and the increment value (what the loop increases by).
